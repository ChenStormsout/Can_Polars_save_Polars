# How to download the dataset  
Run <code>sh ./download_data.sh</code> from the repository root. A downlaod should start and a <code>nyc_parking_violations_2022.parquet</code> file should appear in your directory.  
You do not need to run the shell script yourself if you use the load function provided in
<code>load_dataset.py</code>.
