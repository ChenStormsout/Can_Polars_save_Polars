# RAPL

Because side channels it is behind sudo. I just do `sudo chmod +r /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:0/energy_u` to be able to access it.

# How to download the dataset  
Run <code>./download_data.sh</code> from the repository root. A download should start and a <code>nyc_parking_violations_2022.parquet</code> file should appear in your directory.  
You do not need to run the shell script yourself if you use the load function provided in
<code>load_dataset.py</code>.
